COME BACK TO LATER
Remember that processes arenâ€™t trusted. Verify arguments to file operations and return -1 with
errno set to EINVAL if the arguments are invalid. In particular, check the validity of user space
buffers.

message_slot.c line 255: I got "psentinel id is 18446744073709551611, should be -5"
check why the id was not set to -5

what is expected behavior when reading message of length 0? does the error come from message_slot.c or message_reader?

I inovked open() in message_sender then in message_reader with the same file descriptor and O_RDWR. But in kernel dmesg the inode is the same but file is different:
for write: Invoking device_open (00000000bb26aefb,00000000a9877c67)
for read: Invoking device_open (00000000bb26aefb,00000000023893ab)
Same thing in iocl: the file in write is 00000000a9877c67 and in read is 00000000023893ab



next step for debugging: print channel list by id + message
